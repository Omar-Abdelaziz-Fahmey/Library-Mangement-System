# Library-Mangement-System

Project Overview:

Our project aims to transform how books are organized and accessed across different departments. Using a linked list data structure, we have created functions such as add, delete, edit, search, and data retrieval to streamline book management.

We followed the agile methodology to develop this project.
Sprint Breakdown:

Sprint 1: Planning and Design

- Defined the scope, objectives, and requirements.

- Designed the main menu and user interface.

- Built key functions like mainmenu, returnfunc, and Password.

Sprint 2: Book Management

- Implemented the core functionality: addbooks, deletebooks, editbooks, searchbooks, and getdata.

Sprint 3: Book Issuance

- Added features for issuing books: issuebooks, viewissuebooks, and studentissuerecord.

Sprint 4: Integration and Testing

- Performed unit, integration, and system testing.

- Fixed bugs and errors.

- Deployed the system to ensure its smooth operation.

Data Structures:

We used a linked list to create structures like book, Node, student, and student_Node. Detailed fields for book and student structures enable comprehensive data handling.

Functions:

- Our system includes password protection with three attempts.

- A main menu for easy navigation.

- Functions for adding, deleting, editing, searching, and viewing books.

- Book issuing features with student record keeping.

- Robust testing and deployment procedures.
